WANGU
Watching Arbitrary Numbers Go Up / A Godot GUI experiment

Built with the Godot game engine:

Heavily inspired by the browser game "Trimps" by GreenSatellite:

Uses the Freesans family of fonts, which can be found here:

All attempts in the past to document or plan ahead for development have failed me, so this time around I am approaching this game on-the-natch.
There is no design doc, no roadmap, no milestones, no issues. Just progress.
