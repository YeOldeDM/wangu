WANGU
Watching Arbitrary Numbers Go Up / A Godot GUI experiment

Original Project source:
https://github.com/YeOldeDM/wangu

Built with the Godot game engine:

Heavily inspired by the browser game "Trimps" by GreenSatellite:

All attempts in the past to document or plan ahead for development have failed me, so this time around I am approaching this game on-the-natch.
There is no design doc, no roadmap, no milestones, no issues. Just progress.

(Okay...so there are issues...)



NOTE TO THOSE USING OLD SAVE FILES: Significant changes to the game's structure has rendered any .sav file generated for WANGU before about 3/1/2016 obsolete and effectively broken. Please go into WANGU's saves folder and delete/move/rename savegame.sav..and have fun starting from scratch!
