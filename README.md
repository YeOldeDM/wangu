WANGU
Watching Arbitrary Numbers Go Up / A Godot GUI experiment

Built with the Godot game engine:

Heavily inspired by the browser game "Trimps" by GreenSatellite:

Uses the Freesans family of fonts, which can be found here:

All attempts in the past to document or plan ahead for development have failed me, so this time around I am approaching this game on-the-natch.
There is no design doc, no roadmap, no milestones, no issues. Just progress.

CLEANER BRANCH
This branch is highly broken and most likely will not be playable in any form of the word. Unless you are testing something specific in this branch, you will want to go grab the master branch of this project if you want to play the game.
