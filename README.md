All attempts in the past to document or plan ahead for development have failed me, so this time around I am approaching this game on-the-natch.
There is no design doc, no roadmap, no milestones, no issues. Just progress.

BRANCHES    
master - most current functioning iteration. If you just want to play, use this branch.    
cleaner - general clean-up and optimization of game code. Most likely broken at any given point in time.    

REPORTING BUGS/CRASHES/FEATURE REQUESTS: The most helpful way to contribute to the project and report any bugs, or anything you'd like to see in the game, is to open an Issue in the Issues tab of the Wangu github site.    
You can usually find me lurking on IRC at irc.freenode.net, channel #godotengine, or my own personal channel ##bathwater.
